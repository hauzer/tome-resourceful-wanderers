# Resourceful Wanderers

Help Wanderers make use of trees which are otherwise hard or impossible to use due to:
* Insufficient or non-existent resource generation.
* Other dependant talents.
* Missing mastery talents.
* Missing items.
* Anything specific, like Chronomancy/Spellbinding and such.

Any time a category or tree is learned which is dependant on something specific that you don't already have, one or multiple 'Wanderer' trees will be granted locked as well.

These trees are usually at x0.8 mastery, and can have less or more than 4 talents, learnable out-of-order.

Wanderer trees can be removed under certain conditions, and this will fully refund category and talent points. The exact conditions are detailed in each tree's description.

Every Wanderer now knows the Shoot talent from the get-go, and starts with iron mail armour in addition to everything else.
