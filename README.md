# Resourceful Wanderers

Help Wanderers make use of trees which are otherwise hard or impossible to use due to insufficient or non-existent resource generation.

## General

Every Wanderer now knows the Shoot talent from the get-go, and starts with iron mail armour.

## Steamtech

The first time a steamtech tree is learned, the tinker escort quest will be automatically resolved. Also, two steam generator implants, two iron steamsaws and two iron steamguns will be added to the inventory.

## Equilibrium, Souls, Insanity

When a first-of-its-kind talent which uses equilibrium, souls or insanity is learned, a relevant random resource-generation talent or a set of talents will be learned as well.
- These are only given if you don't already know a relevant resource-generating talent or a tree containing one.
- Only talents which pass the non-level, non-stats checks are eligible. For example, non-Dwarves won't be granted Stone Warden talents.
- The first-of-its-kind talent you yourself learn is non-unlearnable, i.e. you won't be able to unlearn it.
- The randomness takes the seed into account.

The possible granted talents/talent groups are as follows:

### *Equilibrium*
- Meditation
- Stoneshield
- Stone Vines and Eldritch Vines
- Nature's Defiance
- Ancestral Life
- Healing Nexus
- Psiblades and Nature's Equilibrium
- Mucus
- Mitosis and Reabsorb
- Swallow
- Jelly

### *Souls*
- Soul Leech
- Raze

### *Insanity*
- Diseased Tongue
- Worm That Walks and Foul Convergence
- Carrion Feet
- Digest
- Mutated Hand
- Entropic Gift
- Dark Whispers
- Netherblast
- Rift Cutter
- Black Monolith
- Tentacled Wings
- Decaying Grounds

Note that some of the talents are passives, so it may not be obvious at a first glance that you got them (i.e. nothing shows up on the hotkey bar).
