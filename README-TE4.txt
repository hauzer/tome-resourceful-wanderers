Help Wanderers make use of trees which are otherwise hard or impossible to use due to insufficient or non-existent resource generation.

<hr/>

[size=20]General[/size]

Every Wanderer now knows the Shoot talent from the get-go, and starts with iron mail armour in addition to everything else.

<hr/>

[size=20]Steamtech[/size]

The first time a steamtech tree is learned, the tinker escort quest will be automatically resolved. Also, two steam generator implants, two iron steamsaws and two iron steamguns will be added to the inventory.

<hr/>

[size=20]Equilibrium, Souls, Insanity[/size]

When a first-of-its-kind talent which uses equilibrium, souls or insanity is learned, a relevant random resource-generation talent or a set of talents will be learned as well.

[list]
[*]These are only given if you don't already know a relevant resource-generating talent or a tree containing one.
[*]Only talents which pass the non-level, non-stats checks are eligible. For example, non-Dwarves won't be granted Stone Warden talents.
[*]The first-of-its-kind talent you yourself learn is non-unlearnable, i.e. you won't be able to unlearn it.
[*]The randomness takes the seed into account.
[/list]

The possible granted talents/talent groups are as follows:

[i][size=17]Equilibrium[/size][/i]
[list]
[*]Meditation
[*]Stoneshield
[*]Stone Vines and Eldritch Vines
[*]Nature's Defiance
[*]Ancestral Life
[*]Healing Nexus
[*]Psiblades and Nature's Equilibrium
[*]Mucus
[*]Mitosis and Reabsorb
[*]Swallow
[*]Jelly
[/list]

[i][size=17]Souls[/size][/i]
[list]
[*]Soul Leech
[*]Raze
[/list]

[i][size=17]Insanity[/size][/i]
[list]
[*]Diseased Tongue
[*]Worm That Walks and Foul Convergence
[*]Carrion Feet
[*]Digest
[*]Mutated Hand
[*]Entropic Gift
[*]Dark Whispers
[*]Netherblast
[*]Rift Cutter
[*]Black Monolith
[*]Tentacled Wings
[*]Decaying Grounds
[/list]

Note that some of the talents are passives, so it may not be obvious at a first glance that you got them (i.e. nothing shows up on the hotkey bar).
