Description
-----------

Help Wanderers make use of trees which are otherwise hard or impossible to use due to insufficient or non-existent resource generation.

When a talent which uses equilibrium, souls or insanity is first learned, a relevant random resource-generation talent or set of talents will be learned, if none of those were already known.

The first time a steamtech tree is learned, the tinker escort quest will be automatically resolved and a steam generator implant will be added to the inventory.

Note that some of the talents are passives, so it may not be obvious at a first glance that you got them (i.e. nothing shows up on the hotkey bar).
